# Essential components

## General information

This is where a general description of the repo would go. This could include (but is not limited to):  

- names of people working in the repo  
- where the data came from  
- broad research questions and analyses to address those questions  

## Data and file overview

This is where a description of the data and files could go. For example, you could describe:  

- the data file format, when you accessed the data, etc.  
- the different code files and what they contain  

## Rendered output (specifically for this class)

For 193DS assignments, you should put a link to the rendered .html file here so that it is easy to access. For example, the rendered .html for this repo is [here](https://an-bui.github.io/new-repository/test-document.html).

**Note: you should have at least a "General information" section, a "Data and file overview" section, and a "Rendered output" section in your README for full credit.**

# Nice things to have

## Sharing and accessing information

This is where any information regarding data/code reuse and access would go. This is mostly relevant if you're working with your own data or data that your collaborators have collected.

## Methodological information

This is where any information about the methods used to collect, clean, or wrangle the data could go. If you do any cleaning/wrangling outside of the code (for example, directly in the .csv file), then you should describe what you did in this section.

## Data-specific information

This is where the metadata would go if you don't have a metadata file or sheet in your repository.
